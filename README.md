# Overview

<img src="img/walker-demo.gif">

In this project we will be building a simple program that allows us to control the movement of a box with the arrow keys. As a challenge, try limiting the movement of the "walker" to the boundaries of the board. Then, add a second "walker" and turn the program into a game of tag!

## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with the template repository
- Apply lesson on detecting keyboard inputs
- Make connections to the Bouncing Box program and recognize patterns

# Lesson Steps

## **TODO 1: Update the Box ID and Style**

üéØ **Goal:** Rename the box in your HTML to `walker` and customize its appearance with CSS.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Update the HTML ID**

   - Open `index.html`.
   - Find the line that creates the game box:
     ```html
     <div id="gameItem"></div>
     ```
   - Change the `id` from `gameItem` to `walker`.

2. **Update the CSS Styles**
   - Open `style.css`.
   - Either modify the existing `#gameItem` styles, or create a new rule for `#walker`:
     ```css
     #walker {
       width: 50px;
       height: 50px;
       background-color: green;
     }
     ```
   - üé® Try customizing the walker‚Äôs color, size, or shape to make it unique!

      <strong>üîó Matching IDs:</strong> The <code>id</code> you set in HTML must match the CSS selector used to apply styles. For example, an element with <code>id="walker"</code> should be styled using <code>#walker</code> in your CSS.<br><br>
      <strong>üé® Custom Styling:</strong> CSS allows you to change the walker‚Äôs size, color, and shape. Get creative and give your walker a unique appearance!<br><br>
      <strong>üí° jQuery is Coming:</strong> In future steps, you‚Äôll begin using <code>jQuery</code> to select and modify HTML elements using their IDs ‚Äî just like in CSS. For example:  
      <code>$("#walker")</code> selects the same element that <code>#walker</code> styles in CSS.
    </td>
  </tr>

<br>

### ‚úÖ **Check Your Work!**

- Your walker should now appear on the screen with your custom style.
- If the walker disappears:
  - Check that the ID in your HTML matches the selector in your CSS (`#walker`)
  - Make sure your style changes were saved

## **TODO 2: Register Keyboard Inputs**

üéØ **Goal:** Set up an event listener that runs a function whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Find the Setup Code**

   - üîç Open `index.js`.
   - Locate the **SETUP** section where jQuery is used to listen for events with this pattern:
     ```js
     $(document).on("...", handleEvent);
     ```

2. **Update the Event Type**

   - Replace the event type with `"keydown"` so that it listens for key presses.

3. **Update the Handler Function Name**

   - Replace `handleEvent` with a new function name: `handleKeyDown`.
   - This is the function that will run when a key is pressed.

4. **Rename the Function**

   - Find the existing `handleEvent` function definition in the **CORE LOGIC** section.
   - Change the function name to `handleKeyDown`.

5. **Log the Key Code**
   - Inside `handleKeyDown`, use `console.log()` to print the numeric key code:
     ```js
     console.log(event.which);
     ```
   - This will help you confirm that key presses are being registered correctly.

      <strong>üß™ Console Logging:</strong> Always log values you don‚Äôt understand! Use <code>console.log(event.which)</code> to confirm your handler is working correctly.
    </td>
  </tr>

<br>

### ‚úÖ **Check Your Work!**

- Preview your game using **Live Server**, then open your browser‚Äôs **Console**.
- Press keys and make sure numeric codes (like `37`, `38`, `40`, or `87`) show up in the console.
- If nothing appears:
  - Double-check that your event type is `"keydown"`
  - Make sure the handler function is named `handleKeyDown` and used in both places

## **TODO 3: React to Specific Keys**

üéØ **Goal:** Create a `KEY` object to store key codes and use `if` statements to react to arrow key presses.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create a `KEY` Object**

   - üîç In the **SETUP** section of `index.js`, create a constant called `KEY` that maps key names (like `LEFT`, `UP`, `RIGHT`, `DOWN`) to their numeric key codes.
   - We'll give you the code for the **Enter** key, but you'll need to figure out the others on your own:
     ```js
     const KEY = {
       ENTER: 13,
       LEFT: ___,
       UP: ___,
       RIGHT: ___,
       DOWN: ___,
     };
     ```
   - üí° Use the console from the last TODO or visit [keycode.info](https://keycode.info) to identify the correct values.

2. **Update `handleKeyDown`**

   - Inside the `handleKeyDown` function, write a series of `if` statements that respond to each arrow key.
   - Example:
     ```js
     if (event.which === KEY.LEFT) {
       console.log("left pressed");
     }
     ```
   - Repeat for `KEY.UP`, `KEY.RIGHT`, and `KEY.DOWN`.

3. **Test Your Key Bindings**
   - Open the console and press each arrow key.
   - You should see the appropriate direction printed for each one.

<br>

### ‚úÖ **Check Your Work!**

- Use Live Server and open the **Console**.
- Press each arrow key. You should see:
  - `"left pressed"` for ‚Üê
  - `"up pressed"` for ‚Üë
  - `"right pressed"` for ‚Üí
  - `"down pressed"` for ‚Üì
- If not:
  - Check your `KEY` values and spelling
  - Confirm your `if` statements are using `event.which`

## **TODO 4: Declare `walker` Variable**

üéØ **Goal:** Create an object to store the walker's position and speed on the screen.

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create a Global `walker` Variable**

   - üîç Scroll to the **SETUP** section in `index.js`.
   - Declare a variable named `walker`.

2. **Assign an Object to `walker`**

   - The `walker` variable should store an object.
   - This object will represent the current state of your game character and should include the following properties:
     - `x` ‚Äî horizontal position (left/right)
     - `y` ‚Äî vertical position (up/down)
     - `speedX` ‚Äî horizontal speed
     - `speedY` ‚Äî vertical speed

3. **Initialize All Values to `0`**
   - Each property in the object should start with a value of `0`.
   - ‚úÖ If you‚Äôre not sure about syntax, think back to how objects were created in the data shapes project.

<br>

### ‚úÖ **Check Your Work!**

- Make sure you‚Äôve declared a global variable called `walker` and assigned it an object with **four properties**: `x`, `y`, `speedX`, and `speedY`.
- Each of these should start with a value of `0`.
- Your program won‚Äôt crash yet if this is missing ‚Äî but future steps **depend** on this structure being present and correct.

<!-- 4 line breaks between TODOs -->

## **TODO 5: Update the Walker's Position in Code**

üéØ **Goal:** Write a helper function that updates the walker‚Äôs location based on its current speed.

      In this project, we‚Äôre storing all of that data in a single object called <code>walker</code>.<br><br>
      So instead of <code>positionX</code>, we now update <code>walker.x</code>.<br>
      And instead of <code>speed</code>, we use <code>walker.speedX</code>.<br><br>

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Define the Function**

   - üîç Scroll to the **HELPER FUNCTIONS** section in `index.js`.
   - Create a function called `repositionGameItem()`.

2. **Update the Walker‚Äôs `x` and `y` Properties**

   - Inside your function, add the horizontal speed to the x-position.
   - Then add the vertical speed to the y-position.
   - Be sure to use **dot notation** to update both values within the `walker` object.

3. **Call the Function from `newFrame`**
   - Inside the `newFrame` function, call `repositionGameItem()` so that the position updates continuously as the game runs.

<br>

### ‚úÖ **Check Your Work!**

- You should now have:
  - A new function called `repositionGameItem()`
  - A call to that function inside `newFrame()`
- Try temporarily assigning a number to `walker.speedX` or `walker.speedY` and use:
  ```js
  console.log(walker.x, walker.y);
  ```
  to check if the values are changing correctly each frame.

## TODO 5: Declare Some Helper Functions

**READ:**
Now that we have our data tracking in place, we need to use that data to actually move the `walker` game item on each `update`. This is a problem solved in Bouncing Box.

> > **REMINDER:** The below code snippets are taken directly from _Bouncing Box_ and are not the exact code that you should use here. They are merely _examples_ of how to solve a similar but simpler problem.
>
> To reposition the box in Bouncing Box we wrote:
>
> ```js
> positionX += speedX; // update the position of the box along the x-axis
> ```
>
> And to redraw the box in the new x-location we wrote:
>
> ```js
> $("#box").css("left", positionX); // draw the box in the new location, positionX pixels away from the "left"
> ```

**CODE:**

- **5a)** In the HELPER FUNCTIONS section, declare two new functions called `repositionGameItem()` and `redrawGameItem()`.
- **5b)** Reference the code above to complete these two functions such that they can reposition and redraw the GameItem to move along the x-axis AND the y-axis.
- **5c)** Call each function on each `newFrame`.

**HINT 1:** Use the `"top"` CSS property to draw the box `y` pixels from the `"top"`

**HINT 2:** Check what the id of the GameItem is for your jQuery statements.

**HINT 3:** Keep in mind that you have an object storing your data this time. There are no "positionX", "speedX", ect. variables, so you will need to use the properties of your object.

<br>
<h3 align="center">YOU DO NOT NEED TO OPEN LIVE SERVER FOR THIS TODO</h3>
<br>

## TODO 6: Update `speedX` and `speedY` with the Keyboard

**READ:**
The box isn't moving yet because we initialized the `speedX` and `speedY` properties to `0`. As long as `speedX` is `0`, the `walker` game item will not move along the x-axis. The same goes for `speedY` and the y-axis.

When we press a key, we want the `walker` game item to move in that direction which we can accomplish by, for example, setting the `speedX` propery to some positive number when the right arrow is pressed and setting to a negative value when the left arrow is pressed. Then, on the following `newFrame`, the position of the `walker` game item will be recalculated based on the the code we wrote in TODO 4.

**CODE:**

- **6a)** Modify your `handleKeyDown` function such that when the `KEY.LEFT` key is pressed, the `speedX` property is set to `-5`:

```js
if (event.which === KEY.LEFT) {
  walker.speedX = -5;
}
```

- **6b)** Do the same for the other 3 arrow keys.

> **Question: Why does the box only move diagonally after your press the keys? Take a moment to think about it if you aren't sure. Understanding this can really help you with understanding game mechanics in general**

<hr>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

  <h3 align="center"><b>CHECK YOUR LIVE SERVER AND TEST EACH DIRECTION. REFRESH THE PAGE BETWEEN EACH TEST TO STOP THE DIAGONAL MOVEMENT</b></h3>
  <p align="center"><b>Do you see the walker moving in the appropriate direction? Again, diagonal movment will occur if you don't refresh the page after pressing a key</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>DO NOT MOVE FORWARD UNLESS YOU SEE THE WALKER MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARROW KEYS</b></p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## TODO 7: Reset `speedX` and `speedY` on `"keyup"`

**READ:**

We now have motion! However, the `walker` game item doesn't stop moving once we set it off. We need some way to stop it from moving.

Ideally, the `walker` game item would stop moving once we release the arrow key. This `"keyup"` event can be listened for in the same way that the `"keydown"` event can be listened for.

**CODE:**

- **7a)** Similar to the code that you've already written in TODO 5, set up your program to listen for `"keyup"` events and set the `speedX` and `speedY` properties to `0` whenever the arrow keys are released. This will involve both creating the `handleKeyUp` event handler function and registering it.

<br>
<br>

  <h3 align="center"><b>CHECK YOUR LIVE SERVER AND TEST EACH DIRECTION</b></h3>
  <p align="center"><b>Do you see the walker stopping when you release the arrow keys?</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>DO NOT MOVE FORWARD UNLESS YOU SEE THE WALKER STOPPING WHEN YOU RELEASE THE ARROW KEYS</b></p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## TODO 8: Implement Borders

Your final task is to make sure that the walker object does not leave the board area.

**CODE:**

- **8a)** Make a helper function called `wallCollision()`. In this function, use conditionals to prevent the walker object from leaving the board. You may use `$("#board").width()` and `$("#board").height()` to get the x coordinate of the right wall and the y coordinate of the bottom wall, respctively. You may hardcode the coordinates of the left and top walls as `0`.

**HINT:** Do not reverse the speed if there is a collision, as this will make your object bounce. Instead, simply subtract the speed from its current position.

- **8b)** Call your `wallCollision()` function from your `newFrame()` function. You will want to call it after `repositionGameItem()` but before `redrawGameItem()`.

<hr>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

  <h3 align="center"><b>CHECK YOUR LIVE SERVER AND TEST EACH DIRECTION</b></h3>
  <p align="center"><b>Do you see the walker stopping when it reaches the edge of the board?</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>DO NOT MOVE FORWARD UNLESS YOU SEE THE WALKER STOPPING WHEN IT REACHES THE EDGE OF THE BOARD</b></p>

# Challenge Ideas:

Do these if you have time. They are not required, but it will help you out if you know how to do them.

## Add a second player that can be controlled with WASD

What will you need to add to the setup area? What will you need to add to the core logic? What new helper functions will you need?

## Make the player(s) change color when clicked on

If you want the colors to be random, you can produce a random color with the following code:

```js
var randomColor = "#000000".replace(/0/g, function () {
  return (~~(Math.random() * 16)).toString(16);
});
```

There are other, less cryptic ways to produce random numbers, but if you just want a random color, this will work. However, you may use other methods of changing colors as well.

## Detect when the two players collide to make a "tag" game.

After the two players collide, make the player who is "it" turn red and move each player to the opposite corners of the screen. Try making the "it" player have a slightly slower speed so that the other player can escape more easily (and maybe make the board bigger).
